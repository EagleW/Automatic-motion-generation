# Automatic motion generator
Introduction
==========
This repository contains required scripts to convert existing amc and asf files or bvh file along with character model into synthetic video. All character model in sample folder are generated by Autodesk character generator.

Run
==========
### Entry and Settings
# Prerequisite:
Software: amc2bvh, motionbuilder<br />
Library: pyfbsdk (included in motionbuilder)<br />
Character models you plan to apply retargeting scripts. Suggest using Autodesk character generator to generate character because the export fbx file will be characterized already when downloaded from website. You can delete the light in the character model if you don't like it.<br />
<br />
# Skeleton mapping:
You can change the mobuMap(line25) in the retargeter.py to corresponding skeleton mapping if you don't use amc2bvh and try to directly convert bvh file.<br />
<br />

# Functionality:
Amc2bvh can batch convert asf and amc files into bvh files<br />
Retargeter.py can retarget bvh files into existing character model to render video<br />
<br />
# Light and Camera Setting:
You can change camera(line 135) and light(line 140) to change positions of cameras and lights. Also, you can change light type in (line 350)<br />
<br />
### Conversion from asf and amc to bvh:
Create list_asf.txt, list_amc.txt,list_bvh.txt, List the source files in amc, asf list and destination into bvh list<br />
Run AMC2BVH file<br />
<br />
### Retargeting bvh files to multiple fbx character models:
Open motionbuilder<br />
Run the retargeter.py<br />
Choose the folder which characters prototype exists and then choose the source of bvh file <br />
